## Installations Needed
Beyond the installation of the Anaconda distribution of python, there should be no other necessary libraries needed to run the code. All libraries required will be installed in the first section of the code. There should be no issues running the code when using Python Version 3. The data needed was provided by Udacity, but is sadly not available in this repository due to its size (128MB). To write the code, I used a jupyter noteboook.

## Project Motivation
The motivation of this project was to predict customer churn for a fictional music service - Sparkify. This involved loading and cleaning the data set. I then conducted Exploratory Data Analysis to understand what features may be useful to predict churn. After analysing these features I did some Feature Engineering for features I found to be useful in EDA. Finally, I preprocessed and then went through trying different models.


## File Descriptions
The file used for the analysis can be found in this github repository. I used the 128MB data set provided by Udacity - "mini_sparkify_event_data.json".

## Results of Analysis
The main findings of the analysis can be found in my post on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@samanthahakes/can-we-predict-whether-a-customer-may-leave-b5f0e4271d6d).


## Licensing, Authors and Other Acknowledgements
I'd like to thank Udacity and the instructors for the courses throughout the Nanodegree, as well as the extracurricular course on Spark.
